#summary: An example talk using Academic's Markdown slides feature.
abstract: "Abstract: Quantum affine algebras are types of quantum groups whose representation theory have been intensively studied, in relation with some natural questions arising from mathematical physics.  In this talk, I will focus primarily on a category O of representations of such a quantum group. We will see how the input from combinatorics, via cluster algebras, yields results in the study of these representations."
