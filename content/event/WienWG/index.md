#summary: An example talk using Academic's Markdown slides feature.
abstract: "In this talk, I will present intertwining operators from the point of
view of quantum groups, that is R-matrices.
R-matrices are the solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation (or braid
relation), which is at the origin of the introduction of quantum groups.
I will explain all of these concepts, with a focus on the case of
quantum affine algebras, for which interesting things happen!
If there is time, we will also see the link with mathematical physics,
where R-matrices appear in the study of spectra of quantum integrable
systems."
