#summary: An example talk using Academic's Markdown slides feature.
abstract: Schur-Weyl duality is often used to relate type A Lie groups (or quantum groups) to symmetric groups (or Hecke algebras). In this talk, I will use ribbon calculus and skein modules to describe an instance of this Schur-Weyl duality between representations of the type A quantum group at roots of unity and representations of the Double Affine Hecke Algebra. This is based on joint work with A. Chandler, A. Mellit and C. Novarini.
