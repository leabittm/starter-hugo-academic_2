#summary: An example talk using Academic's Markdown slides feature.
abstract: "It is known that some Grothendieck rings of categories of representations of quantum
affine algebras can be endowed with cluster algebras structures. This is true for example
for certain categories O containing the category of finite-dimensional representations. On
the other hand, certain Grothendieck rings of categories of finite dimensional representations admit remarkable t-deformations, which are linked to quiver varieties and are useful
to compute characters. The aim of this work is to obtain such t-deformations in the
context of categories O. Our approach is based on quantum cluster algebras."
