#summary: An example talk using Academic's Markdown slides feature.
abstract: I will present the basics of the theory of representations of quantum affine algebras. We will see the quantum affine analogs of the fundamental representations, called "l-fundamental", and more generally we will focus on the so-called "standard modules", which play a key role in the particular preprint which is the focus of this working group.
